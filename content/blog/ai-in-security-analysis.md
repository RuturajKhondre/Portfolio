## The Information Overload

A typical Security Operations Center (SOC) receives thousands of alerts daily. "Alert fatigue" is real, leading to missed threats and burnout. This is where AI steps in—not to replace analysts, but to augment them.

## Data-Driven Defense

AI excels at correlation. It can take logs from firewalls, endpoints, and cloud services to construct a complete narrative of an attack.

### Use Cases

1.  **User Entity and Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**: Baseling normal user behavior to detect anomalies (e.g., a user logging in from North Korea at 3 AM).
2.  **Phishing Detection**: NLP models analyzing email context, not just keywords, to catch sophisticated spear-phishing attempts.
3.  **Automated Triage**: Grading alerts by severity so analysts focus on what matters.

## The Human Element

AI provides the "what" and "where," but the human analyst provides the "why." In my [Gender Bias Detection](/projects) project, I explored how bias in training data can affect outcomes. The same applies to security—models must be tuned to avoid false positives.

## Future Outlook

We are moving towards "Self-Healing Networks" where AI not only detects threats but automatically isolates affected systems to contain damage. The future of security is autonomous, but supervised.
